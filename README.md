# Invoice Mate

Invoice Mate is a Flutter-based mobile application developed for a live client project aimed at streamlining the process of generating and managing invoices. Due to client confidentiality and authorization constraints, I am unable to share the source code for this project. However, below are screenshots of the application that provide an overview of its functionality and design. These snapshots offer a glimpse into the Invoice Mate application and its features.
